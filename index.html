The Visual Studio integrated development environment is a creative launching pad that you can use to edit, debug, and build code, and then publish an app. An integrated development environment (IDE) is a feature-rich program that can be used for many aspects of software development. Visual Studio is a terrific tool, but I would stick with a text editor and an interpreted language like Python to teach first principles. Once you start writing non-trivial programs, however, a good IDE is indispensable, plus it's a real-world environment that you are likely to end up working in.

In e.g. Visual Studio Code (or other IDEs like e.g. Eclipse) console applications are running on a console integrated in the IDE. When the app has finished, the output is still visible. If the JavaScript Console window is closed, you can open it while you're debugging in Visual Studio by choosing Debug > Windows > JavaScript Console.
